Software Test and Automation
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

The best way to ensure that code is functional and secure is through testing. This can include static testing, by analyzing the code, or dynamic testing like writing tests to see if the code will do what is was intended to. 

The best way to interpret user needs and incorperate them into a program is by testing for them. If a program has a list of requirements and the developer should make tests for them. If those tests pass, the program meets the requirements which is awesome!

The way I used to approach software design was to read the requirements and start writing code. Periodically I would look back at the requirements to see if I was still on track. If I ran into snags, I would write an if statement to test something I wasn't confident on and move onward. As this class as taught me, that way of thinking is not the best. If I write code, there should be tests to make sure the code does what I want it to do. Those tests should reflect he requirements.
